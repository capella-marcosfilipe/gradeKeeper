# Study: Saving my grades into a .txt file
*After having accomplished my first course in Python, I was eager to study more about file handling using python scripts. In my first Python course, we finished creating a system where we could register people's name and age. So, I started by modifying that to registering the grades in the classes I'm taking at my Software Engineering school.*

This Python app should let the user:
- See any registered grades;
- See the classes they're taking;
- Register a new grade to their classes:
- Leave the system.

In the future, I want to improve by doing the following:
- Work with databases;
- Register student's names and keep it;
- Register new classes;
- Show necessary grade to succeed a class;
- Be able to differentiate bimesters;
- Work with a User Interface;
